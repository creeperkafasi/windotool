# windotool
An xdotool clone for windows written in c#

## Current Goals:
- Support most xdotool commands
- Clean up the code

## Long-term Goals:
- Support all xdotool commands and features so that existing xdotool scripts can be ran with minmal changes (just ignore the x-specific flags)
- Optimize the code and the executable size as much as possible
- Add support for windows-specific features (idk...)
